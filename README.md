# Avocado-Analysis
Avocado analysis including the region, price, and volume
This was my first Project I did,
I got the dataset off kaggle (link is in the notebook).
The kaggle task was to see which region produced the greatest amount of avocados, 
I wanted to see how much of a difference of price there was between organic and regular avocados and also the difference in volume per year.
